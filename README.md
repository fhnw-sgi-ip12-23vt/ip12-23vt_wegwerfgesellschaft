## Project Overview

This game was developed as part of a project at the University of Northwestern Switzerland ([FHNW](https://www.fhnw.ch/de/)) for the energy company [Primeo](https://www.primeo-energie.ch/privatkunden.html). It is an arcade game programmed in Java aimed at educating children and young people about the throwaway society.

## Runtime Dependencies

This project uses Pi4J V.2, which requires the following runtime dependencies:

- [**SLF4J (API)**](https://www.slf4j.org/)
- [**SLF4J-SIMPLE**](https://www.slf4j.org/)
- [**PIGPIO Library**](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio) (for the Raspberry Pi) - This library is pre-installed on recent Raspbian images, but can also be manually installed using the instructions found [here](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html).

This application also utilizes a JavaFX user interface, fully detailed in the [User Interface with JavaFX](https://v2.pi4j.com/getting-started/user-interface-with-javafx/) documentation.

## Build Dependencies & Instructions

To build this project, you need [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.6 or later and Java 11 OpenJDK or later. Ensure these prerequisites are installed before proceeding. Use the following Maven command to clean previous builds and package the project:

```
mvn clean package
```

## Setup New Raspberry Pi

To set up a new Raspberry Pi, follow this guide: [Pi4J setup new Raspberry Pi](https://pi4j.com/getting-started/set-up-a-new-raspberry-pi/). Set the resolution of the monitor in the `monitors.xml` file to 800x600 for optimal performance and fullscreen.

## Install on Raspberry Pi

The game is pre-installed on the Pi. However, if you need to re-install the game, follow these instructions:

### Install Manually

1. Copy the compiled code (target) to your Raspberry Pi in `/home/pi4j/deploy`.
2. To manually run the application on the Raspberry Pi, execute the start-app.sh script:

```
sudo ./start-app.sh
```

3. To enable the application to start automatically after a boot or reboot, run the install-service.sh script:

```
sudo ./install-service.sh
```

### Install via Run Configuration

You'll need:

- A Java IDE (like IntelliJ)
- Network connection

Ensure your local machine is connected to the same network as your Raspberry Pi, then follow these steps:

1. Configure the IP address in the pom.xml file.
2. Select the Run on Pi.run.xml run configuration.
3. Execute the configuration. Upon a successful build, the new code will be transferred to the Pi (/home/pi4j/deploy), and the scripts will execute automatically, replacing any old project in this directory and setting up the service.

## Game Modifications

### Language and Text

Languages can be configured by the user via the options screen. This changes all text labels within all screens. The new language is applied as soon as the submit button at the end of the settings screen is pressed.
To change any text messages, edit the language JSON files in `/home/pi4j/deploy`

### Configurable Variables

These can be edited in the configurableVariables.json file located in `/home/pi4j/deploy`.
- Difficulty level (items per second and drop speed)
- Points per item for the three different types
- Total game time

### General Structure

The project is structured according to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) concept. For each screen, the timer, the scoring system, and the three entity types, there are:

- **Controller class:** Holds the logic for the game object. Structural methods can be found here.
- **Model class:** Holds data regarding the game object. Getter and setter methods can be found here.
- **View class:** Contains visualizations for each game object. Visuals can be found here.

To make changes, identify the corresponding game object affected and apply the MVC concept to choose the correct class to modify.
