## Project Overview

This game was developed as part of a project at the University of Northwestern Switzerland ([FHNW](https://www.fhnw.ch/de/)) for the energy company [Primeo](https://www.primeo-energie.ch/privatkunden.html). It is an arcade game programmed in Java aimed at educating children and young people about the throwaway society.

## Runtime Dependencies

This project uses Pi4J V.2 which requires the following runtime dependencies:

- [**SLF4J (API)**](https://www.slf4j.org/)
- [**SLF4J-SIMPLE**](https://www.slf4j.org/)
- [**PIGPIO Library**](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio) (for the Raspberry Pi) - This library is pre-installed on recent Raspbian images, but can also be manually installed using the instructions found [here](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html).

This application also utilizes a JavaFX user interface, fully detailed in the [User Interface with JavaFX](https://v2.pi4j.com/getting-started/user-interface-with-javafx/) documentation.

## Build Dependencies & Instructions

To build this project, you need [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.6 or later and Java 11 OpenJDK or later. Ensure these prerequisites are installed before proceeding. The following Maven command will clean previous builds and package the project:

```
mvn package clean
```

## Run on RaspberryPi

### Compile via Run Configuration
Ensure your local machine is connected to the same network as your Raspberry Pi then follow these steps:

1. Configure the IP address in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file.
2. Select the [Run on Pi.run.xml](.run%2FRun%20on%20Pi.run.xml) run configuration.
3. Execute the configuration. Upon a successful build, the new code will be transferred to the Pi (`/home/pi4j/deploy`) and the scripts will execute automatically, replacing any old project in this directory and setting up the service.

#### Compile Manually
After a successful build, locate the generated files in the `/target/distribution` folder. Copy these files to your Raspberry Pi (`/home/pi4j/deploy`) using SCP.

To manually run the application on the Raspberry Pi run the [start-app.sh](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fscripts%2Fstart-app.sh) script:
```
sudo ./start-app.sh
```

To enable the application to start automatically after a boot or reboot run the [install-service.sh](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fscripts%2Finstall-service.sh) script:

```
sudo ./install-service.sh
```
